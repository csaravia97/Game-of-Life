# Game-of-Life  
## Description
Intro to Computing team project. Implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life onto grids provided to the class by the professor.
Required us to learn how to read and write to files in C++, as well as learn how to manipulate multidimensional arrays.

There are many test files in here because my group and I were trying to test our code out on small cases before working on the large grids that we were provided.
